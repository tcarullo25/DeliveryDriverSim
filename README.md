## Overview

This project provides a detailed simulation of food delivery services, akin to platforms like DoorDash and UberEats. By modeling drivers, orders, and city layouts, we can understand key performance metrics, optimize delivery routes, and study the impact of various parameters on the overall efficiency of the system.

## Features

- **Grid Layout**: Simulate a city's road network with customizable grid sizes.
- **Driver and Order Dynamics**: Model the behavior of drivers, from picking up to delivering orders.
- **Analysis Tools**: Dive deep into metrics such as average delivery times, driver earnings, and order delays.
- **Visualization**: Use powerful visual tools like Matplotlib to understand the data.
  
## Visualization and Analysis

This project integrates Matplotlib for data visualization. After running a simulation, various charts and graphs will provide insights into the system's behavior.

- **Driver Earnings Distribution**
- **Order Delivery Times**
- **Order Delay Durations**
- **Driver Idle Times**
- ... and more!
