1. DONE: do threshold instead of quadrant
2. DONE: add non productive time which is idle time + time from driver loc to order pickup
3. DONE: pickup time - the timestep the restaurant will have it ready PREDETERMINED
          dropoff time - delivery by time PREDETERMINED (maybe measured by reputation of restaurant?)
4. DONE: more flexible rate based on duration (meet a certain wage)
5. #TODO: reputation score for drivers based off meeting the pickup time & dropoff time (this should break ties into which driver gets the current order)
           add reliability correlating with reputation score (random seed)
6. #TODO: make tests look nicer
7. #TODO: adding order while have a current order


# not currently reflecting driver distance as they proceed in route

# if order is overdue, increase price ? 

# give drivers policies & name driver's by their trait to better understand data

# order objects should have the price of the actual order, then tip should be calculated from that and added to base pay
# flat fee should be a separate parameter (like a base pay)
