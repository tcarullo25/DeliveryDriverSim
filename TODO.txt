# not currently reflecting driver distance as they proceed in route

# if order is overdue, increase price ? 

# give drivers policies & name driver's by their trait to better understand data

# order objects should have the price of the actual order, then tip should be calculated from that and added to base pay
# flat fee should be a separate parameter (like a base pay)

# do threshold instead of quadrant

# add non productive time which is idle time + time from driver loc to order pickup

# adding order while have a current order

#TODO: pickup time - the timestep the restaurant will have it ready
#TODO: dropoff time - delivery by time (maybe measured by reputation of restaurant?)

#TODO: reputation score for drivers based off meeting the pickup time & dropoff time (this should break ties into which driver gets the current order)
#TODO: later on, add reliability correlating with reputation score

#TODO: more flexible rate based on duration (meet a certain wage)
