#DONE: make bunch of predetermined requests (order time that comes in, starting location, destination) in separate file (deterministic) (also for the grid layouts too)
#add min and max in matplotlib, charts that show distributions 

#DONE add how far driver traveled

#DONE: add new attribute to order for ending destination

#DONE: calculate all distances to pickup locations, pick shortest distance driver

#DONE: get rid of distance

# might not need num nodes or num drivers in init sim anymore
